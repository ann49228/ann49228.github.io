		<h1>Millennial's Guide to the Holiday Season</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			When the holidays roll around, it is easy to lose sight of what's really important. Family and Friends. The late night partying, constant decorating, excessive eating and last minute shopping distract us from enjoying the peace and comfort that comes with the holiday season. We forget to spend time with family and friends, we forget to honor the less fortunate and we most of all forget to enjoy it.
		</p>
		<h4>But this guide is here to fix all of that.</h4>	
		<p>These tips and tricks will get you through the Holiday feasts, and through the gift giving unscathed.</p>
			    
		<h3>November: Thanksgiving and Shopping Holidays</h3>
		
			<ul> 
				<p>
				<li> 
					<strong><i>Thanksgiving</i></strong>: Although the origins are problematic, it is an excuse for family and friends to gather at the richest sibling's house to eat, drink and gossip during the nationwide 4 day long weekend. <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/holidays-recipes/slideshow/best-thanksgiving-recipes">Recipes to ensure a memorable thanksgiving feast!!</a>

			<p>
			<li>
				<strong><i>Black Friday</i></strong>: This is the day after thanksgiving that claims to be the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Really its just an excuse for retailers to get rid of last season's items by cutting prices by 50-90% simultaneously promoting a culture of excess and consumerism. <br> <u>Go-To Black Friday Shopping Destinations:</u> </br>

			  <li>Mall of Georgia</li>

		<h3>December: Christmas and New Year's Eve</h3>
		<ul> 
			<p>
			<li> <strong><i>Christmas</i></strong>: This is the holiday that all holidays countdown too. The ultimate celebration of the Year. Christmas is the predominantly the gift giving day so it's important to be prepared. <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2016/12/man-repeller-holiday-2016-gift-guide.html">Gift Guide for a Happy Wife and a Happy Life!</a>

	<p>
		<li> 
			<strong><i>New Year's Eve</i></strong>: This is the last event of the Holiday season. A time to party away the woes of the past and create the regrets of the future. Sequins, glitter and champagne are all the rage.
